## About

I am an Indian *software engineer* with more than a decade of experience.

I have been working with big data since the last 5+ years. Currently I am the **architect** of the big data team at InsideView (acquired by Demandbase).

In the past as a **tech lead engineer** I created the [REST APIs](https://api.insideview.com) for Insideview from *scratch* using Jersey, Docker and Hibernate.

In the initial 5+ years of my career I have worked on creating backend services for webapps using Spring, Hibernate etc.
